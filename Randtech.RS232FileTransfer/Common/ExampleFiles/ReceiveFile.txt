this is the file that will be created on the SEND computer.
the file contents will be on many lines but will not be more than 300 chars.
note that the file will ALWAYS start with 5 numbers.
if you would like an EOF character, this is possible.
A handshake back from the RECEIVE computer should be made before the SEND program terminates
A suitable handshake might be checking that the number of chr$ in each file match.

this program has no HMI - but should through up the following dialog boxes appropriately for 2 seconds

FILE TRANSFER FAILED


there should be a file in C:\data\FileTransfer\... called FileTransferSend.txt which will contain the following:

C:\data\datafile.txt
com 6

This tells the program what com port to use and what dir and file name to load.
The .exe will reside in C:\data\FileTransfer\
